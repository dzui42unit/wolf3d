# wolf3d

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way

Your mission will be to write,
using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find
his/her way.

The generation a maze is implemented.
